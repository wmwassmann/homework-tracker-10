## Status

Project Status: In Progress.

This is one that I didn't understand when I first worked on it, but ever since 11/18, which is when we started working with RPG: Adventurer's Academy database work, this has become easier to grasp.  I struggled with console work, because I didn't have a visible thing to see other than words on the screen, which I struggle with.  But I understand it more now that before - I'm just hitting a deadline.

Update 12/11. Most of this is "functional" with a few issues with the routing on Update employee role and Remove employee.  I have limited time, and I would like to revisit this if I have time, but for right now this is probably as good as it gets.
